# Preferred Critical Points for Optimizers

We will be taking a deep dive into different optimizers, and discussing both theoretically and in practice the preferred minima of different optimizers.

The goal of this project is to be able to better pick an optimizer if there is information known about the geometry of the objective function, along with a slight benefit of knowing which optimizers prefer flatter objective functions, which on average tend to generalize better.
